        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><img src="/Media/img_0267_720.jpg" alt="picture of me">My name is Sergio Velasco, I was born in South America but
          moved to
          Miami, FL and raised there until I went to college in Gainesville, FL. Go Gators! I graduated from college
          with a
          Bachelors in Applied Physiology and quickly realized the field was not for me. I bounced around a few jobs
          gaining
          experience and also moving from Miami to Tampa, FL. Here is where I started realizing I needed to go back and
          study
          something better suited for me and then BOOM!... the pandemic hit. I had to do the best with what was dealt to
          me
          and that meant finding a decent job to help assist with income and not be affected by the pandemic so I landed
          on
          Amazon! I've been with Amazon ever since and thankfully found the career choice option to help study something
          I can
          make a lasting career out of.</p>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey began in middle school when I started playing video games on PC's that required more help from
          other
          extensions. I found it so interesting that even though game developers could create a game, other people out
          there
          would create their own version of the game/extension to alter the same game. Ever since, I have wanted to
          learn
          software development and practice more but I never had the proper resources to dive in completely. I went
          through
          college with this "pipe dream" on the back burner thinking it was almost impossible to attain. I've had
          multiple
          jobs in healthcare and retail since the college days but now I'm taking this opportunity through my current
          employer
          to put all my attention and learn what I have always been wanting to. I feel like I've barely scratched the
          surface
          with all that is software development so I'm trying to gain all the knowledge I can and when I'm not, I will
          try
          practicing everything I've learned.

        <h2>Personal Achievements:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Although I dont use some of the knowledge I studied in college, it was still a big achievement being a
            first
            generation college grad.</li>
          <li>Going back to school to learn a completely different set of skills to start a new career.</li>
          <li>I've learned to cover three different (PA) process assistant roles in the warehouse I work at so I'm
            always
            being called upon to figure something out.</li>
          <li>I've had a Hole-in-one on a legit golf course. <a href="https://www.ironwoodgolfcourse.org/"
              target="_blank" alt="ironwood golf course">Ironwood Golf Course</a> (Gainesville, FL), Hole 14, 164 yards.
            Honestly, one of my
            proudest achievements. </li>
